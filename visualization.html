            <div style="margin-left:20px;color:#555;font-size:12px">Files flagged as semantically similar or potential duplicates (from <code>duplicates</code> and fuzzy matches). High density of similarity edges suggests duplicate logic or copy/paste that may be refactorable.</div>

            <div style="margin-left:20px;color:#555;font-size:12px">Explicit file paths mentioned inside issue messages. These indicate where human or model-generated feedback points to another file.</div>
            <div style="margin-left:20px;color:#666;font-size:11px;font-style:italic">Suggested action: follow references to confirm root cause and linked locations.</div>

        <div style="margin-top:10px;font-size:12px;color:#444">
          <div><strong>Node size</strong>: larger nodes indicate higher importance (tokenCost, issue count, or dependency weight).</div>

          <div style="margin-top:6px;color:#666;font-size:11px">Relatedness: proximity between nodes (and slightly larger node size) indicates contextual relation; we do not draw explicit 'related' edges to avoid clutter.</div>
